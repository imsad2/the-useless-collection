# the-useless-collection
A collection of software that serve no purpose other than waste your time. Forking is encouraged!

Requires Python 3.9.

## Usage
Go into the folder of the software you would like to run and double-click the `run.bat` file. If you are not on Windows 10, worry not! As long as you have Python 3.9 installed, you can simply run the `main.py` file and have "fun". Windows 10 users can also do this, although the `run.bat` file is a viable option.
