# the-useless-collection
A collection of software that serve no purpose other than waste your time.

Requires Python 3.9 and guizero.

## usage
Go into the folder of the software you would like to run(excluding `guizero-master`) and run the `run.bat` file. If you are not on Windows 10, worry not! As long as you have Python 3.9 installed, you can simply run the `main.py` file and waste your time. Windows 10 users can also do this, although the `run.bat` file is a viable option.
